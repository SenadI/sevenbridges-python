    "2. Get resource - `api.projects.get(id='user/project')` - returns a specific resource, denoted by the id\n",
    "2. Query resources - `api.projects.query()` method returns a pageable list of type `Collection`. The same goes for other resources, so `api.tasks.query(status='COMPLETED')` returns a Collection of completed tasks with applied default paging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic methods can be generic (for all resources) and specific.\n",
    "They are called on the concrete object, like a `Project` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we have `project` variable as a `Project` object:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Delete resource - `project.delete()` - deletes object (if supported on the API).\n",
    "2. Reload resource from server - `project.reload()` - reloads state of the object from the server.\n",
